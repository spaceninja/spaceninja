### Hi there üëã

I'm a front-end architect and CSS specialist in Portland, Oregon with over 20 years experience building scalable user interfaces. My specialty is refactoring large code bases for maintainability and performance, and helping teams define best practices and workflow around CSS development. Between my education in graphic design and my experience working alongside programmers, I bridge the gap between design and development.

A running theme in my career has been helping others level up, and that‚Äôs most recently manifested in the [Friday Front-End](https://fridayfrontend.com/) and [CSS Basics](https://twitter.com/cssbasics) twitter accounts and newsletter, which I use to share development tips and links with the front-end community every day. My first book, ‚Äú[How to Find a Better Job in Tech](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0VOE6O),‚Äù was published in 2016.

_Specialities: Web Standards, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Vue, Nuxt, Svelte, Sass, BEM, SMACSS, OOCSS, Mobile-First, Responsive Web Design, Refactoring, WordPress, Browser Testing, Scrum_
